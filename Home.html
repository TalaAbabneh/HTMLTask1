                    They are filled with life and joy.<br> 
                    The pet store in Crossroads Mall was a small one,<br>
                    but in 2010 it wasn't so fun for one 10 year old boy.<br>
                    I went to the mall with my mom, dad, brothers and sister.<br>
                    I wanted to stay at the pet store longer,<br>
                    So phong, Nhi, and I stayed back while my parents and little <br>
                    brother went to shop.<br>This was the first time they left me alone in a store and I got scared and panicked.<br> 
                    This was the day I learned to find help when needed.</p>

                <P style="margin-left: 50px; margin-top: 6%;">A pet is like a family member.<br>
                     Having a pet is more like looking after a child,<br>
                      but pets cannot speak.<br>
                       If you shower them with love and affection, <br>
                    they will be most affectionate and loyal to you. </P>
